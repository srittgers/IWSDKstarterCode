# IWSDK Starter Template

Just a basic iwsdk template with a couple changes to make it work on github codespaces

To run
on the terminal, change directories into the project folder (e.g type "cd iwsdk-app")
on the terminal, stare the app running by typing "npm run dev" (should result in opening in the browser on computer)

To see in Quest headset
Go to ports tab and change visibility of the port (8081) to "public" (right-click > "port visibility" > "public" ) 
(otherwise you will need to log in to github in the browser)
