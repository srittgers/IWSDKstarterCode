# IWSDK Starter Template

Just a basic iwsdk template with a couple changes to make it work on github codespaces

To run
cd into the project folder (cd iwsdk-app)
npm run dev (should result in opening in the browser on computer)

To see in Quest headset
Go to ports tab and change visibility of port 8081 to public (otherwise you will need to log in to github in the browser)
